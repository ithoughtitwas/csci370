The two apps are buying a car and solving the Or logic operator. This is supervised learning. The general approach to building a simple ML model is to get the data, scale the data if wanted, train the model, and then use the model. No testing nor validation is done in this notebook.\n","\n","Note: This program assumes that an app has exactly two attributes to keep the coding more simple.\n","\n","One of the ways to learn what works and what doesn't in machine learning is to experiment. For example, try without scaling and then with scaling."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"HlLToOOUUcNI"},"source":["# Set global parameters\n","\n","myApp = 'Car buying' # 'Car buying' or 'Or logic'\n","\n","myScale = False # either True or False\n","\n","myCar = 1 # 1 or 2 for the data file"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"yMqLAHt-gfa8"},"source":["# Import needed libraries\n","\n","%matplotlib inline\n","\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","import requests\n","from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"El7XeZboS7kW"},"source":["# Check global parameters\n","\n","if myApp == 'Car buying':\n","    print('The car buying app it is')\n","    if myCar == 1:\n","        myDataset = 'carBuyData.csv'\n","    elif myCar == 2:\n","        myDataset = 'carBuyData2.csv'\n","    else:\n","        print('**** WARNING car data file must be 1 or 2 ***')\n","elif myApp == 'Or logic':\n","    myDataset = 'orData.csv'\n","    print('The or logic app it is')\n","else:\n","    print('*** WARNING app ' + myApp + ' does not exist ***')\n","  \n","if myScale not in [True, False]:\n","    print('Set the scaling parameter to True or False')"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Uk8MxPBmCnSK"},"source":["# Input dataset\n","\n","url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ithoughtitwas/csci370/main/data/' + myDataset\n","myDf = pd.read_csv(url)\n","print(myDf)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"7x0GBX7kjfiV"},"source":["# Ready the training set (data) and visualize it\n","\n","# This function creates a scatterplot for visualizing data.
